    L&T Technology Services was founded in 2009 as L&T Integrated Engineering Services. In its first year, the company generated $70 million in revenue. Initially, it only operated as the engineering arm of the L&T[4] and in 2013, as a result of the L&T's strategy, the parent company was split into "nine verticals and six subsidiaries", of which this was one.[10][11] It began to expand its engineering services as a developer of new technology solutions[buzzword] for other companies under a new brand name L&T Technology Services (LTTS).[4]

In September 2016, LTTS had its initial public offering in the National Stock Exchange, making it the second L&T subsidiary to go public.[12][13] A. M.
